Make use of btrfs subvolumes/snapshots:

1) The backup destinations (LEVEL1, LEVEL2, etc) should be separate
   btrfs subvolumes.  Then deleting them happens in a flash!
2) Create the LEVEL1, LEVEL2 destinations by btrfs snapshotting the
   most recent prior backup.  This happens in a flash.  Then drop
   the --link-dest stuff as it is no longer needed.
3) If the source is on btrfs, snapshot it first before taking the backup
   and then drop that snapshot.  This ensures an image at a
   single-point-in-time.   If it is lvm2, you can use lvm snapshotting
   instead.
